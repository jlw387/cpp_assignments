2) a) The array will be destroyed, making the reference to it point-
      less and also potentially dangerous.
   b) The recursion has no termination point, so the function will
      recurse infinitely (Is recurse a verb? Not really sure...).
   c) These two functions only differ by return type, which is
      unacceptable since the program will have no way to tell which
      version should be called.
   d) First of all, what even is that array size? Who needs 100
      million elements of an array if they're not even gonna
      initialize it? Second of all, the array isn't even being 
      initialized, so it will literally just print 0 over and over
      again. Third of all, the size of the array will probably cause 
      a stack overflow. 
   e) First, main usually doesn't have parameters, but more
      importantly, the array passed in may not even have a second 
      element, which would break the program. Then, if it does, 
      int wouldn't match the type of the element being assigned to
      it.
