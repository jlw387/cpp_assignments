1) Symbolic constants are much better to use than “magic number” 
   literals because changing the value of the symbolic constant 
   will change the value for all uses of the constant whereas if 
   a “magic number” were used in place of the constant, each use
   of the “magic number” would need to be altered individually to
   make a change. Furthermore it allows the programmer to name
   the constant based on its intended use to clarify the program.
   Symbolic constants are better than #define constants because
   they require much less effort to debug.
