5 a) The variable count will attempt to access an element of the
     array that doesn't exist (array[5]) on the last iteration of
     the loop. To fix this, I'd simplt change the line 'count <= 5'
     to 'count < 5'.

  b) Since the pointer 'ptr' is a constant integer pointer, you 
     can't assign anything to it. Making the pointer non-constant
     solves this problem.

  c) For-each loops aren't able to work with pointers since the
     length of the array isn't known. Adding a length parameter to
     the function and using a normal for loop will solve this issue.

  d) 'temp' is a fixed array, and therefore cannot use a length that
     is not known at compile time. To fix this the array should be
     dynamically allocated.

  e) The pointer does not match the type of the variable to which it
     is pointing. The type of the pointer should be changed to
     'double*'.
